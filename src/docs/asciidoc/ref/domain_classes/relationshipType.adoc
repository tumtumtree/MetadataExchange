= Relationship Type

the model catalogue core plugin includes the following relationship types as a default:

|===
|RelationshipType | Source           | Destination  | Source->Destination    |  Destination<-Source
|[containment]
|Model
|DataElement
|"contains"
|"contained in"
|[heirachical]
|Model
|Model
|"parentOf"
|"ChildOf"
|[supersession]
|DataElement
|DataElement
|"supercedes"
|"supercededBy"
|===

These relationship types can be used to create <<_relationships, "Relationships">> between <<_catalogue_element, "Catalogue Elements">>

WARNINIG: containment, context, hierarchy, inclusion, instantiation and supersession relationship types should not be removed from the registry

Additional relationshipTypes can be configured by adding to the following list in @Config.groovy@

[source,groovy]
