= hide-if-logged-in

Attribute directive for hiding elements based on whether the user is logged in or not. If the user is currently
logged in then the element is hidden. It listens to <<_userloggedin, "User Logged In" Angular Event>>
and <<_userloggedout, "UserLoggedOut" Angular Event>> to change the visibility when the user logs in or out.

See <<_security, "Security" Angular Service>> for more details.

== Usage
Add an attribute to any element to hide it when the user is logged in:
[source, html]
----
<a href="/login" hide-if-logged-in>Login</a>
----
