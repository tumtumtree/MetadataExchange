= show-for-role

Attribute directive for showing elements based on the roles of logged in user. If the currently logged in user (if any)
has role given as the value for this attribute then the element is visible. It listens to <<_userloggedin, "User Logged In" Angular Event>>
and <<_userloggedout, "User Logged Out" Angular Event>> to change the visibility when the user logs in or out.

See <<_security, "Security" Angular Service>> for more details.

== Usage
Add an attribute to any element to show it only when the user has particular role:
[source,html]
----
<p show-for-role="ADMIN">Only admin will see this message</p>
----
