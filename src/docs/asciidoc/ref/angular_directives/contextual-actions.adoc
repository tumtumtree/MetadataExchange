= contextual-actions

Element directive for rendering all actions applicable for the current scope. By default it uses the scope at the place
of insertion (more specific the parent scope of scope created for instance of this directive) but this can be
overridden by `scope attribute.

You can tune the appearance of the rendered actions by using self-explanatory attributes: `iconOnly`, `size`, `group` and `noColors`.
`size` attributes for default implementation accepts `xs`, `sm` and `lg` which are used with `btn-` prefix.

== Usage

Considering you have following code in you controller:

[source, javascript]
----
$scope.element          = {/* ... */}
$scope.nested           = $scope.$new(true)
$scope.nested.hello     = "Hola"
----

And following HTML snippet in your page:
[source, html]
----
 <contextual-actions size="sm" icon-only="true" group="true" scope="nested" no-colors="true"></contextual-actions>
----

Than you get all actions applicable for the `nested` scope rendered in small grouped toolbar with icons only. If you
omit the scope argument, you will get all actions applicable for the current scope.

== Customization
You can override the `modelcatalogue/util/ui/contextualActions.html` template to plug your own either using
`text/ng-template` script definition, creating the template on the appropriate location in your server
or using the http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$templateCache[$templateCache]. The content of root element is
replaced by the group inner elements - the <<_action_button_single, "Action Button Single" Angular Directive>> or <<_action_button_dropdown, "Action Button Dropdown" Angular Directive>>
depending on whether the action has or hasn't any children.
