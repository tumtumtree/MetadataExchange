= show-if-logged-in

Attribute directive for showing elements based on whether the user is logged in or not. Only if the user is currently
logged in then the element is visible. It listens to <<_userloggedin, "User Logged In" Angular Event>>
and <<_userloggedout, "User Logged Out" Angular Event>> to change the visibility when the user logs in or out.

See <<_security, "Security" Angular Service>> for more details.

== Usage
Add an attribute to any element to show it only when the user is logged in:
[source,html]
----
<a href="/logout" show-if-logged-in>Logout</a>
----
