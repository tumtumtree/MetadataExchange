= hide-for-role

Attribute directive for hiding elements based on the roles of logged in user. If the currently logged in user (if any)
has role given as the value for this attribute then the element is hidden. It listens to the <<_userloggedin, "User Logged In" Angular Event>>
and <<_userloggedout, "User Logged Out" Angular Event>> to change the visibility when the user logs in or out.

See the <<_security, "Security" Angular Service>> for more details.

== Usage
Add an attribute to any element to hide it when the user has particular role:
[source, html]
----
<p hide-for-role="ADMIN">Admin won't see this message</p>
----
